# Honors Thesis: Forecasting Non-Stationary Time Series with Causal Invariance

## Overview

This repository contains all the work for my honors thesis completed under the supervision of Prof.Matteo Riondato at Amherst College, Computer Science Department. The thesis focuses on finding invariant causal mechanisms that enable robust time series forecasting in non-stationary environments.
